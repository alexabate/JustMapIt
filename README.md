# JustMapIt

How well are Tucson citizens served by access to fresh produce, especially as a function of income level? 

This project, developed as a part of Code for America's National Day of Civic Hacking (Tucson chapter), creates a visualisation comparing data from the US census on population density and median household income to the availability of local grocery stores.

Visualisations such as this can help cities and non-profit organisations plan how to distribute their food bank services most efficiently.

Useful extensions:
- toggle between different census data on the map, e.g. population density and poverty index
- identify low income/below poverty line areas greater than 15 minutes walk from a grocery store
